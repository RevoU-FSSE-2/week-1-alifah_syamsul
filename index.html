            <h2>📬 About me</h2>
            <p>👩🏻‍💼 I used to work as a product manager for 4,5 years. As a product manager, I worked at Traveloka, Kitabisa, and GovTech Edu; last, I worked at Cookpad UK. It looks like I moved a lot, but trust me, I didn’t actually mean to 🥹</p>

            <h2>🔫 Hobbies</h2>
            <p>🔥 I enjoy engaging in a few hobbies in my spare time. 📺 I like to watch TV series with my boyfriend; we’re currently watching Spy×Family. 🫂 On the weekends, I enjoy hanging out with my friends. 🎹 I’m also taking a flute class—I learned piano for some time, and then I decided to switch my primary instrument to the flute. 🪈 I want to pursue the Level 6 certification for flute, either in ABRSM or Trinity. 🎶 <br> 🍳 Finally, I derive a lot of enjoyment from cooking, whether trying out a new recipe or improvising with ingredients on hand. I get agitated if I don’t cook for some time. I must tell you that I cook the best <i>ayam ungkep</i> 🍗!!!</p> 

			<p>Overall, my hobbies bring me a lot of happiness. I hope. My cat brings me a lot of annoyance though, lol. 🐈 Here is an image of me and my cat:</p>
